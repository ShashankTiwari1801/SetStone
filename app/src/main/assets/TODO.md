## 1. Goals

The primary objective of this redesign is to modernize the visual appearance and improve the usability of the application without altering its core features or functionality. The redesign aims to align the app’s interface with current UI/UX standards, reduce cognitive load, and create a more pleasant and consistent user experience.

### 🎯 High-Level Goals
- **Modern Look & Feel**: Adopt clean, minimalist aesthetics with updated typography, spacing, and color schemes.
- **Reduce Clutter**: Eliminate visual noise by removing unnecessary elements, simplifying layouts, and introducing visual hierarchy.
- **Improve Readability**: Use better font pairings, consistent sizing, and sufficient contrast to enhance legibility.
- **Consistent UI Components**: Create a unified design system with reusable components to reduce inconsistency.
- **Better User Flow**: Improve screen layout and navigation to make user journeys more intuitive and faster.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the UI adapts well across screen sizes (if applicable).

### 🧩 Sub-Goals
- Establish a fixed design system (typography, spacing, color).
- Unify button styles, input fields, and icons.
- Simplify overly complex screens into modular sections or steps.
- Improve accessibility by following standard contrast and tap target guidelines.
- Minimize distractions and focus user attention on primary actions.

### 🔚 Outcome
At the end of this redesign, the app should:
- Feel faster and more intuitive to use.
- Be visually appealing and consistent across screens.
- Make it easier for new users to onboard and existing users to navigate confidently.
